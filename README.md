# Machine-learning-in-python-Homeworks
This repository contains a collection of projects I completed during the Machine Learning in Python course. Each project focuses on various machine learning concepts and techniques, showcasing my understanding and proficiency in Python programming and machine learning.
## Project 1:
The objective of this homework assignment is to work on the exercise notebook from Lesson 7 of the Intro to Machine Learning course and apply various feature selection techniques to improve the performance of a regression model for predicting house prices.
## Project 2:
The objective of this homework assignment is to work on a Kaggle competition called "Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." The goal of this project is to predict the sale prices of residential homes based on various features such as the size of the property, number of rooms, quality of materials used, etc.
## Project 3:
The goal of this project is to implement various techniques for handling categorical features in a machine learning model. The project uses the "Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users" dataset, which includes both numeric and categorical features. The project is divided into several questions, each focusing on a different technique.
